UNRESOLVED BUGS

+ two_axes doesn't work correctly with negative numbers and zero_axis
+ y_max_value doesn't get adapted for bars and area if all negative values
+ init_graph does too much work for pies. Needs to be split up.

NOT REALLY BUGS

- overwrite == 2 only makes sense if all the data is either positive,
  or negative
- A positive y_min_value doesn't work with bars or area, bars and area 
  always are set off against 0. Wether this is a bug, or wanted behaviour
  might be a point for discussion.
