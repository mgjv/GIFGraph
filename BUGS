UNSOLVED BUGS

+ two_axes doesn't work correctly with negative numbers and zero_axis

NOT REALLY BUGS

+ overwrite == 2 only makes sense if all the data is either positive,
  or negative
+ a positive y_min_value doesn't work with bars or area, bars and area 
  always are set off against 0. Wether this is a bug, or wanted behaviour
  might be a point for discussion.
