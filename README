This is GIFgraph a package to generate GIF charts, using Lincoln
Stein's GD.pm.

INSTALLATION

needed to install (also see TESTED PLATFORMS):

	perl 5.004
	GD > 1.14

to install:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

NB: make test is no longer available. Because of the differences in
the versions of GD, it was almost impossible to make a set of reliable
tests. If everybody out there had a recent version of GD, there would
be no problem. Instead of 'make test', Just have a look at the
samples. If they look ok, then GIFgraph will work.

to see some samples:

	cd samples
	make

or, if you have a decent make, try

	make samples

from this directory

That should generate a set of gifs, which you can view using the HTML
pages in the same directory (or whichever other way pleases you).

The documentation available is contained in GIFgraph.pm, as pod.

The latest release should normally be available from CPAN. Older
version may still be available from
http://www.tcp.chem.tue.nl/~tgtcmv/perl/, but that location will no
longer be maintained

MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE VERSION 1.10

- plot_to_gd method added
- some bug fixes
- worked on some samples
- removed tests from distribution

MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE VERSION 1.04

- added bar_spacing option
- added limited support for numerical X axis for equidistant X values
  (NOT for a real numerical graph!), thanks to Scott Prahl.
- routines to automatically 'guess' nice upper and lower values for
  graphs have been replaced by one written by Scott Prahl

MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE VERSION 1.03

- Added mixed type graph.
  GIFgraph::mixed
  options types and default_type
- Added callback functionality to format y values
  option y_number_format
- Added control over axis label placement
  option [xy]_label_position

MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE VERSION 1.01

- Vertical printing of X axis labels
- CHANGED DEFAULTS for zero_axis and zero_axis_only
- Fixed problems with negative values, data ranges without 0, and
  printing of the x axis labels (I hope)
- No more support for perl 5.003. Since perl 5.005 is out, and I don't
  have a 5.003 here to test all the time, I won't support it anymore.

MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.91

- Legends
- Support for negative numbers
- Ticks for X axis
- line types and widths
- Allow entries in data set to be undef (to skip them)
- Changed 'zero' angle for pie charts (was right, now is front/bottom)
- Definition of colours now possible. See GIFgraph::colour::read_rgb
  for details

TODO

- Allow settings for individual data sets
- For mixed graphs, calculate the number of bar sets
- make overwrite = 2 work everywhere
- 3d look for graphs
- logarithmic scaling
- numerical X axes (halfway there)
- Autoloading/splitting, etc

BUG FIXES IN THIS VERSION

See file BUGS

NOTES FOR WIN32

GIFgraph installs and runs well under Gurusamy Sarathy's port of perl
for win32, and its usage is exactly the same as documented.

The ActiveState port 5.003 for win32 can be used with Dave Roth's port
of GD for win32. This port, however has a peculiarity. It is
impossible to manipulate the gif data in memory (the GD::Image::gif()
method always writes to a file descriptor, instead of returning the
data). This makes the use of GIFgraph with that port impossible
without a lot of work.
This means that until someone ports GD for the ActiveState perl with
full support for all its functionality, GIFgraph will not work on
ActiveState's port 5.003. 

It may very well, and _should_ work on the 5.005 ports, although I
have personally not tested that yet.
