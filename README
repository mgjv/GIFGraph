This is an alpha release of GIFgraph, a package to generate GIF
charts, using Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

to install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

to see some samples:
	cd samples
	make

That should generate a bunch of gifs.

Most of the documentation available is contained in GIFgraph.pm, as
pod. Sorry for the incompleteness of it all, and the sloppiness of the
code in places, but remember: this is an alpha :)
