This is an alpha release of GIFgraph, a package to generate GIF charts,
based on Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

to install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

to test:
	cd samples
	make

That should generate a bunch of gifs.

Most of the documentation available is contained in GIFgraph.pm, as pod. Sorry for the incompleteness of it all, and the sloppiness of the code in places, but remember: this is an alpha :)

TODO
