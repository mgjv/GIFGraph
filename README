This is GIFgraph a package to generate GIF charts, using Lincoln
Stein's GD.pm.

INSTALLATION

needed to install (also see TESTED PLATFORMS):

	perl 5.005
	GD > 1.18
	GD::Graph
	GDTextUtils

	Potentially something to convert PNG to GIF (see later)

to install:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

IMPORTANT CHANGE SINCE VERSION 1.10

GIFgraph no longer contains any of the code to generate charts. Instead
it has become a wrapper around GD::Graph. The main reason for this is
that since version 1.20 GD does not support generation of GIF images
directly anymore. Dropping support for GIFgraph alltogether was not
really an option, and having a module called GIFgraph that produces PNG
was a bit silly. So I decided to create GD::Graph, and recommend the use
of that directly, and make GIFgraph a wrapper around that, its only
function being to provide a backward compatible interface to GD.

GD VERSIONS

If you want to use a GD version 1.20 or up, you will need to have
something installed that can do an on-the-fly conversion of PNG to GIF. 
I recommend that you use Image::Magick, since that is what the GIfgraph
module has been setup to use. If you don't want to, or can't install
Image::Magick, you will have to edit the file GIFgraph.pm to provide a
different sub _png2gif.
