This is the first beta release of GIFgraph, a package to generate GIF
charts, using Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

The next release, version 1.00, should support at least what is
documented, and should run on both Unix and Win32 (still not clear
which perl port and GD port I will work with).

to install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

to see some samples:
	cd samples
	make

That should generate a bunch of gifs.

NB: This version has been tested with perl 5.004_04 on a Solaris
    system, using GD 1.15. I cannot guarantee that it will work
    on a perl version below 5.004, or with GD below 1.14. You should
    upgrade anyway.

Most of the documentation available is contained in GIFgraph.pm, as
pod.

NOTES FOR WIN32

I am currently working on a version that will run on win32, but there
are some nasty issues with some ports of GD for win32. I will try to
resolve them asap.
