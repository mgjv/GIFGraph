	1 - $g->('x_number_format' => \&x_format) only works for numerical 
	x axes. Can this be expanded?

	1. Is it possible to do away with the blank space between the
	y-axis and the graph output and the trailing space (area, lines,
	linespoints)?

	2.  Is it possible to create the output without either or both axes?

From: "Thierry Botten" <Botten.Thierry@talkline.de>

	My suggestions :
	1) Display the data used for each chart inside the chart (does
	this work?)
	2) Display the date (and hour?) the graph was created?
	3) Maybe define your own delimiter character (e.g i like '|' and
	others use '~', etc...)

	- I wanted to have different line widths for the different lines
	  on one graph: I changed lines.pm. The parameter line_width is
	  now an array and works in the  same way as line_type. You will
	  find in attached my new lines.pm and a diff of the original and
	  this file.

	- My second wish is to have the possibility to print long ticks
	  for Y and not  for X. This is not possible today because there
	  is only the "long_ticks"       parameter. I did not work on
	  this feature for the moment, but it would really  be great.

Mixed Graphs, all graphs,

	Allow setting of individual options per data set:

	It will not be trivial at all to implement this, but it will require a
	lot of tweaking of the code. I will have a look at it, and try to
	estimate the amount of effort needed. Most likely it means that each
	option needs to be able to take either a single value, or a array ref.
	If it's an array ref, then it needs to take the appropriate setting
	out of the array, or the last one. Something like that. It would
	require writing a wrapper function that does that, and making sure
	that wrapper gets called for all settings that would apply to
	individual data sets.


Positioning of X axis labels (and y axis?)

	Configurable

	No matter what I do, I can't get the first point to appear at
	where the X and Y axes meet; instead, it appears one tick mark to
	the right of zero on the X axis.

	1.
	Is there any reason why pie charts can't have legends? If there is
	a really thin slice a legend is a good way to get the information
	across without polluting the graph with a long data title, (and
	keep it readable).

	2.
	Still on pie charts it would also be nice to be able to get the
	data percentages and the totals in the pie.

	For example one of my pies is a breakdown of the Operating System
	of different machines around the office.

	If the data breaks down

	Linux - 45%
	Solaris - 30%
	Windows NT -25%

	Total system = 100

	It would be nice to have legends with the OS Names, and have
	offset lines from the pie which show the percentages.

	3.
	Bar charts lend themselves to presenting the data that make up the
	datapoint above the bar, whether this is an absolute number, or a
	percentage.

	4.
	It would be nice it bar charts could also have a 3D effect.

	5.
	Nit. I thought you were going to change bars so that I could
	specify each datapoint, (rather than dataset of different colors) ??
