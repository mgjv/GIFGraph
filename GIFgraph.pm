=head1 NAME

GIFgraph - Graph Plotting Module (deprecated)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use GIFgraph::moduleName;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<GIFgraph> is a I<perl5> module to create and display GIF output 
for a graph.

GIFgraph is nothing more than a wrapper around GD::Graph, and its use is
deprecated. it only exists for backward compatibility. The documentation
for all the functionality can be found in L<GD::Graph>.

This module should work with all versions of GD, but it has only been
tested with version 1.19 and above. Version 1.19 is the last version
that produces GIF output directly. Any version later than that requires
a conversion step.

=head1 EXAMPLE

=head1 NOTES

Note that if you use GIFgraph with a GD version 1.20 or up that any
included logos will have to be in the PNG format. The only time that GIF
comes into play is _after_ GD has done its work, and the PNG gets
converted to GIF.
